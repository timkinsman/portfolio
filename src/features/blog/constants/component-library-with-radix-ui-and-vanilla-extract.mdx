In a sea of component libraries out there, this adds nothing. This component library is built for the love of the game, to learn something and for personal use. But, I hope you learn something or you find something helpful in this post.

# Monorepo setup

Firstly, special thanks to [NiGhTTraX](https://github.com/NiGhTTraX) for the great [TypeScript monorepo template](https://github.com/NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo).

That template was the initial starting point for this component library. Some of the tooling and config between nayhoo/ui and NighTTrax/ts-monorepo does differ for personal choices, but a lot of the bones are still there.

The basic project structure overview:
```
+-- apps                  # 
|   |
|   +-- next              # nextjs app example using component library
|   +-- react-cosmos      # 
|   +-- vite              # vite app example using component library
|
+-- packages              # 
|   |
|   +-- ui                # component library package
|   +-- ...               # additional packages
|
+-- package.json          # 
|
+-- pnpm-workspace.yaml   # 
|
+-- ...                   # additional files/folders
```

See the ui package [here](packages/ui).

This monorepo also includes the following additional packages:
- [eslint-config](https://github.com/nayhoo/ui/tree/main/packages/eslint-config): My personal ESLint config for TS projects.
- [hooks](https://github.com/nayhoo/ui/tree/main/packages/hooks): A collection of React hooks.
- [prettier-config](https://github.com/nayhoo/ui/tree/main/packages/prettier-config): My personal Prettier config.
- [tsconfig](https://github.com/nayhoo/ui/tree/main/packages/tsconfig): My personal TS config.
- [utils](https://github.com/nayhoo/ui/tree/main/packages/utils): A collection of utility functions.
